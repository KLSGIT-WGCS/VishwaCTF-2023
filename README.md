## What is a CTF?
A CTF(Capture the flag) is an information security contest where participants are given a number of challenges relevant to computer security. Solving these challenges leads to a secret code often called **flag**, which is then submitted on the CTF platform to earn points and climb up the scoreboard to win.

There are various categories of challenges like:
- Web
- Forensics
- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
- Steganography etc.

For any doubts or queries regarding the writeups/challenges kindly reach out to the authors.
