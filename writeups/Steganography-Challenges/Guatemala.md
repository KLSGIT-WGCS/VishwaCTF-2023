# Steganography
- Challenge Name : Guatemala
- Difficulty :  Easy

## Challenge Description
My friend wanted to install an antivirus for his computer, but the creator of the antivirus was caught!

##### Assets/files : [AV.gif](https://klsgit-wgcs.github.io/VishwaCTF-2023/writeups/Steganography/assets/AV.gif)

## Methodology
A .gif file was provided with the challenge. A seemingly normal gif that totally did not have anything hidden in it (or did it ðŸ‘€):

![AV.gif](https://klsgit-wgcs.github.io/VishwaCTF-2023/writeups/Steganography/assets/AV.gif)

We first ran [Exiftool](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool) on the gif. Exiftool is an open-source tool that can be used for reading and writing metadata(some extra data about the image size,version etc) to a variety of files. An extract of the metadata given by Exiftool :

>Bits Per Pixel                  : 8
>
>Background Color                : 0
>
>Animation Iterations            : Infinite

>**Comment                         : dmlzaHdhQ1RGe3ByMDczYzdfdXJfM1gxRn0=**

>Frame Count                     : 17

>Duration                        : 2.04 s

>Image Size                      : 498x498
>
>Megapixels                      : 0.248

Note the boldened comment attribute, it seems a bit fishy. The value of the comment seems to be a base64 encoded string. We then used an online base64 decoder (there's plenty) and voila, we have our flag !!

You can also use **"base64"** a cmd-line tool built into linux. That will go something like this: 

> base64 -d file-path

Create a file and paste the encoded string in the file. Then execute the above command with that file-path and that will get you the same result.

Tip: base64 encoded strings will ***usually*** end with the '=' sign (Why? Research about it!). That's how you can figure out that it is encoded in base64 !!
